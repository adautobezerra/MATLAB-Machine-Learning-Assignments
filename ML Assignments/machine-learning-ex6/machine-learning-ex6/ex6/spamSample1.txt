Hello Ayushi,

We hope you’re as excited as we are. Round B of Kickstart 2017 starts in a few hours!

As a reminder, this competition is meant to be a fun way for you to get a glimpse into the skills needed to be an engineer at Google. We hope you have fun solving these problems and showing us your skills. The top participants from each round may be invited to interview for career opportunities at Google.

Have fun,

The Kickstart team
